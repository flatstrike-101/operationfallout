Operation Fallout:
Is a Hearts of Iron IV mod about what if no one, won World War II
In this mod's timeline technology is already advanced and in 1918 at the end of the Great War many countries started work on researching on how to make atomic bombs. 
Then in 1939 Germany invaded Poland and this triggered a war, the 2nd Great War. This war raged on until 1948 when the US nuked Berlin and several other cities in 
Germany, then Germany nuked the Soviets, Americans, and many more nations and some where neutral countries.
After a few weeks of nuking each other a Nuclear Fallout occurred killing many people and demolishing many governments making Earth a very unstable planet. Then in 1949 
the big Empires started to collapse the USA collapsed, because people were fighting each other and mobs became big, then many other big Empires fell. Some Empires were 
luck to have remnants of the governments to survive the fallout.
